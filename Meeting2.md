## Summarize and Synthesize Research Notes

![Affinity diagramming themes](/images/meeting2-affinity1.jpg) 

We first talked about how it went and some of the themes we noticed. We each wrote some of the more particular findings on post-it notes and used affinity diagramming to arrive at common themes. Then we organized those themes within the VMT framework developed by [Scott Kubie] (http://kubie.co/vmt/). The framework quickly helped us make our synthesis more concrete, but they are only hypotheses at this point.

**Vision**
- Neighborhood theater where people can relive their favorite movie experiences and share them with new people.
- When the vision is realized, it means that people would have a place where films are not just seen but experienced.

**Voice (experience attributes)**
- Nostalgia
- Fun
- Delight
- Social / Interactive
- Lived experience
- Off-beat
- Personalized

**Mission**
- Central Cinema will deliver tightly-curated experiences that hosts fun, off-beat themed events that you can't find anywhere else.
- It will curate all aspects of the theatre experience including movies, food, and drinks.

**Messages**
- Central cinema is the place to go for a fun night out with your friends while reliving your favorite cult classics.
- Relive your favorite nostalgic movies with your friends over some great food and drinks at your fun, friendly neighborhood theater.
- Not your ordinary movie experience.
- It's PEOPLE'S theatre.

**Target**
- Audiences
  - Current customers are people in their 30s-40s who love cult classics and value off-beat experiences.
  - They love non-mainstream movies and "active" movie watching.
  - More women than men.
  - Family-friendly.
  - The experience of this place is more important than the actual movie.
  - "Someone who comes to watch Bridget Jones is not the same person who comes to watch Point Break."
- Channels
  - Primary: website, buy tickets, give feedback/suggestions, look up upcoming shows and times
  - Secondary: Facebook, Instagram, Twitter ("reinforcers") 
  - Secondary: newsletter, remind people about new shows, events, times

Then after synthesizing and verbalizing what we've all learned, we condensed our findings into business goals and website goals. Business goals would be translated into success metrics that we should aim for; Website goals would be translated into requirements our solutions should fulfill.

**Business goals**
- Increase online and advance ticket sales
  - Increase conversion of people’s interest to ticket purchases
- Increase engagement
  - Get feedback from people on what movies they want to watch
  - Increase newsletter signups
- **Mitigate risks** around staffing, no-shows, volume of traffic

**Website goals**
- “Beautiful, seamless experience”
- Users should be able to see which shows are coming up and purchase tickets for them (through TicketBiscuit)
- Highlight food/cocktail menus
- Highlight non-ticketed / special events
- Encourage people to sign up for newsletter
- Easy to find location / contact info

## Brainstrom Survey Questions

Our research goals were to get a broad understanding of who our customers are, what they do once they get to the website, and how often that happens. One big question we still had was "who are our customers?" 

During the business discovery interview, we found that the audience were niche and depended on the particular showings, so that made it difficult to segment and hone in on our target users. Since we already knew the website needed major reorganization and possible pruning, it was crucial that we understand the top tasks and know how to prioritize them.

We plan on corroborate our survey data with ones the client will (cross our fingers) supply us with – mainly, web analytics. 

**Our goals**
  1. Uncover top tasks to see what users want to do vs. what the business wants to do
  2. How the website is meeting or not meeting users' tasks and focus on top areas of improvement

**Demographics**
- Age
- Gender
- Neighborhood

**Frequency**
- When was the last time that you used the website to buy a ticket? How far in advance?
- How frequently do they visit the website? 
- How many times have you been to Central Cinema in the last 6 months?

**Channels / Web behavior**
- How people are currently buying tickets -- online or at the door? 
- What prompted you to the website? What did you do once you got there?
- What content did you look at? 
- What was the experience of buying tickets like?

## The Kinds of Data We Need from the Wordpress Site

- **Top Pages**
- **SEO data**
- **Navigation paths**
- **Referrals**
