# Lessons Learned

Here, I will keep track of things I've learned throughout the project. This is so I can share what I've discovered with other people who might be facing similar issues.

  1. How do I get a client to respond? Better question: How can you ascertain client commitment and communicate expectations better?
  2. What can you do to boost your team's morale?
