## Discussion

This wasn't our normal meeting as we were given time during class to meet with our group. For an assignment, we each picked a research method and came up with pros/cons for the method. This assignment was supposed to inform our user research plan and make sure our methods were appropriate for the given gaps in our understanding, the business goals, and our constraints.

| Method | Advantages | Disadvantages | 
|--------|------------|---------------|
|Usability testing | Participants represent real users who do real tasks. Think aloud technique give us real-time info about their thought process as they do the tasks. The technique could be adapted between in-lab/field/remote and moderated/unmoderated. | Participant recruitment is time-consuming. Testing with the "wrong" subgroup could skew data. Some participants are not good at think aloud technique, and if so, it would be harder to elicit the right responses. There are some artificiality involved so data might be insightful but may not be accurate. Choosing the "wrong" metric will give you inaccurate data. But some data can't be obtained from observation - like how they feel about the way a website was organized. | 
|Server logs | Data reflects actual usage of website compared to a usability lab. It can represent activity of many users over a long period of time. We can learn who is actually visiting the site, and their entry, paths, and exit points - and whether they were able to complete critical actions like buying a ticket. | When the log file is not comprehensive (have missing data or gaps in the log), it could lead to inaccurate conclusions. Some data cleaning is required since you might have extraneous data. Data collected today may not accurately represent what users want to do tomorrow. We can't get subjective data - why someone chose one path over another. |
|Contextual inquiry | 
|User interviews |
| Survey | 

We also took this opportunity to finalize the survey that the client will send out to its newsletter subscribers. But...this led to the question of, "What are the most important questions to answer right now?"

While talking about the survey questions, it became apparent that we lacked confidence in our direction because we hadn't prioritized what we want to know about our customers. We had a hard time stringing together appropriate research techniques to triangulate our data and provide rationale for why we are doing it that way.

As a team, we dipped into a question framework from content strategy. (Thanks Meghan Casey!)

| We wonder... | We care because... | We assume... | We know... |
|-------------|------------|--------------|------------|
| Something we want to know | Why this is important | What we believe to be true | What we know already |

Then we ranked each question according to importance:
- A = Critical
- B = Dependent on answering A
- C = Nice to know / Maybe later

Our "A" questions were:

| Question | Rationale | Method(s) |
|----------| ----------|-----------|
| Do people know where to go on the website? | We want to find out what was most confusing about the website and what questions they had. We would use this data to uncover critical errors preventing people from purchasing tickets. | Guerilla usability testing? Contextual inquiry? 
| What are the most important tasks people do on the website? | We need to understand top tasks to start to de-clutter the website and give us focus areas to improve. We can also triangulate this data with top pages or referral landing pages to understand frequently visited content and the most popular entry points. | Survey, Analytics, Customer emails
| If people bought tickets online, why? | We want to understand their motivations. Maybe they're more tech savvy or they plan events differently. We want to know WHO these people are. | Interview
| If people didn't buy tickets online, why not? | This is essentially a behavior change question. The business goal is to get more people to buy (advanced) tickets online, so it's important to understand what holds people back and their questions/concerns. | Interview
| How did people decide to go to a (specific) event? | If we understand how they heard about it or what prompted them to go, we can prioritize the most important channels to consider. | Interview

We used this understanding to finesse our [survey questions] (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ngEsb9Kl9o3FQ0Loq_mi5kzaSb4Snl1TD08W84kCeHI/viewform).

This discussion also helped us focus on the questions we should answer during our "site visit" aka going to see a movie at Central Cinema. We plan to do customer intercepts before the movie, observe the actual demographic of a show (probably Shaun of the Dead), and *maybe* ask people to pull up the Central Cinema site and tell us how they might buy a ticket/feel about using it.

## Next Steps
