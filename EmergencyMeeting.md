## Agenda

- Discuss a contingency plan for conducting user research

## Discussion

**Quick update:** It looks like we wouldn't get some analytics and user data from the client in time, so we called an emergency meeting to conduct alternative research to fill in our knowledge gaps. We landed on:

- Heuristic evaluation
- Guerilla usability testing paired with user interviews

**Goal:** We primarily want to understand how people came to buy tickets online and uncover any workflow issues with the website. Since our primary goal is to increase advanced online ticket sales, we need to understand not just issues with the website but also other confounding factors that might influence people's behaviors.

**Questions we still need answers for:**

- Within our demographic profile, how do people make plans with other people and with whom (spouses, kids, groups of friends)?
- Sequencing of behavior -- what's users' mental models around deciding to and buying tickets?
- How do people think about unique shows/events -- how do their behavior change based on whether the show/event is a "destination" or something you might do to "hangout on a Saturday night"?
- Does event discovery methods influence purchase methods? (i.e. Discovering a show in The Stranger might not lend itself to buying tickets easily.) Would a closer coupling of purchase intent and method help? (If Amazon Dash button has anything to say about that...)
- Is this a marketing issue? If people think Central Cinema is *only* an ordinary theatre, they might not be motivated to look further to buy tickets in the first place. Increasing online tickets sales have less to do with the website than with brand/value prop awarness.
- Is there a relationship between conceptualizing Central Cinema as a "Neighborhood cinema" and motivation to buy tickets at the door? If this is *your* neighborhood, and the business mostly draws from the neighborhood, then there's less of a reason to buy tickets online when you can just walk a few blocks and get them at the door.
- How does "community" values factor into the decision to buy tickets online? If you care about your community, you might also want to deal with people face-to-face rather than an impersonal web transaction. If you considers the theatre as a community space, it makes sense to invest time getting to know its members (in-person).

## Next steps
