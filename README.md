#**Web Design Project for Central Cinema**

## About This Project

This is where I will be documenting our process -- our behind the scenes work. I believe in building in public and so I want to give back to people who are enthusiastic from learning from others. 

Also, by writing down what we've learned, decided, and do, I can better able to communicate the work my group is doing.

## About Me

I'm a Master's student in the Human Centered Design & Engineering program at the University of Washington. My group and I are currently in the User Centered Web Design course, and we are working with Central Cinema to redesign their website. 

If you happen upon this and want to give me feedback or encouragement, you can reach me at [clemauy@uw.edu] (mailto:clemauy@uw.edu) or on Twitter at [@clemauyeung] (http://twitter.com/clemauyeung).
