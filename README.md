#**Web Design Project for Central Cinema**

## About This Project

Central Cinema is a neighborhood dinner theather where patrons of all ages can relive cult movie classics and find quirky events off the beaten path. Our team is working to improve [their website] (http://central-cinema.com/) to serve people looking for fun, unique experiences.

This is where I will be documenting our process -- our behind the scenes work. I believe in building in public and so I want to give back to people who are enthusiastic from learning from others. 

By writing down what we have learned, decided, and been doing, I will be able to share our work in progress in a meaningful way.
