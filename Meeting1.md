## Discussion

After we selected our client, Central Cinema, we met to prepare for our client meeting with Kevin, one of the owners of Central Cinema, and discuss the current state of their website. We also looked ahead to the user research methods we might want to use during our redesign.

### Look at the website to familiarize with the business 

We attemped to summarize what Central Cinema was all about to gauge our understanding and ferret out our assumptions.

Central Cinema is...
* Communal, neighborhood theatre
* Friendly, fun movie theatre 
* Kitsch, quirky and whimsical
* A place for food and drinks

We talked about who their customers might be to help us segment them and imagine what the different needs might be. 

Who are their customers?
* Movie theatre patrons (who are interested in seeing a movie while eating and drinking)
 * Repeat patrons who keep coming back for something different
 * Cinephiles - Love older or familiar films
 * People who want the movie + food combo
* Corporate or companies who want to rent

We also talked about the tasks they might do on the website. This will help us understand their information needs and think about some requirements for the website.

* Find what movies are playing
* Find what the times the movies are playing
* Figure out how to buy tickets
* Find contact/location
* Look at the menus

We summarized our exploration by coming up with potential outcomes for the redesign.

* Better information architecture
* Clearer flows for important/top tasks
* Stronger brand identity
* Attract more customers

### Prepare for client meeting on Monday

Based on what we discovered about the business and website, we brainstormed questions we should ask during our client kick-off meeting. We also wanted to set the right expectations so we included questions about working relationships and communication methods.

Brand and Business goals
* How do you describe Central Cinema?
* Why did you start your company (or this project)? What led you to the idea?
* What is your primary revenue stream?
* What channels do you sell through?
* Which is the most important?
* What are your business goals for the next 3 - 4 months?
* For this website, what are the top three goals? What do you want people to do?
* Who needs to be able to use this website?

Customers/Users
* Who are your current customers and what do you know about them?
* Who are your prospective customers and what do you know about them?
* What do they care about? 
* How do you prioritize them?
* How do most people find out about you?

Working Relationship
* How often would you like us to communicate with you? How involved do you want to be in the redesign?
* Who else, apart from you, will be involved with the redesign?
* How do you currently decide what goes on your website? Who is responsible posts to the website?

We also discussed the general user-centered design process we would present to Kevin (our client stakeholder) should he asked. We also used this information to create a rough schedule for executing this project.

* Business Discovery
* User Research and Synthesis
