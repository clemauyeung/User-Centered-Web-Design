## Discussion

After we selected our client, Central Cinema, we met to prepare for our client meeting with Kevin, one of the owners of Central Cinema, and discuss the current state of their website. We also looked ahead to the user research methods we might want to use during our redesign.

1. Look at the website to familiarize with the business 

We attemped to summarize what Central Cinema was all about to gauge our understanding and ferret out our assumptions.

Central Cinema is...
* Communal, neighborhood theatre
* Friendly, fun movie theatre 
* Kitsch, quirky and whimsical
* A place for food and drinks

We talked about who their customers might be to help us segment them and imagine what the different needs might be. 

Who are their customers?
* Movie theatre patrons (who are interested in seeing a movie while eating and drinking)
 * Repeat patrons who keep coming back for something different
 * Cinephiles - Love older or familiar films
 * People who want the movie + food combo
* Corporate or companies who want to rent

We also talked about the tasks they might do on the website. This will help us understand their information needs and think about some requirements for the website.

* Find what movies are playing
* Find what the times the movies are playing
* Figure out how to buy tickets
* Find contact/location
* Look at the menus

We summarized our exploration by coming up with potential outcomes for the redesign.

* Better information architecture
* Clearer flows for important/top tasks
* Stronger brand identity
* Attract more customers

2. Prepare for client meeting on Monday
