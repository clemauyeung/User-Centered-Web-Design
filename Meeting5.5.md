![Persona Workshop] (/images/Persona%20Workshop.jpg)

During class, we were led through a persona workshop by Kate Ramsey and Rebecca Shapiro from Nordstrom's UX team. The steps we took to create our potential personas were based on their workshop:

  1. Drawing on research, what were the themes? What the known or desired categories of users? Put them on stickie notes.
  2. Brainstorm the needs, wants, frustrations, and motivations that all users in our space might have.
  3. Group like needs and goals. See how they map to the themes and categories we've already came up with beforehand. Are there new themes and categories?
  4. Look at the top tasks to determine which user categories are the most important. How do these compare with who the organization thinks are the most important users? Then come up with their most important needs. Give each user category a quick summary using bullet point descriptions. (These are your persona skeletons.)
  
Although we followed all the steps, our group were still struggling with categorizing user types. The approach we took to better conceptualize our personas was to pick 2 dimensions and map our current types onto 4 quadrants of the 2x2 matrix. The dimensions we felt were reflected in our data were:

- romantic evening and group setting (using our contextual inquiry data)
- new customers and repeat customers (based on different info needs)

Once we plotted our current categories of users onto the 2x2 matrix, we narrowed our focus further to new custmers seeking a more romatic setting and repeat customers coming to Central Cinema in a group. We decided not to focus on repeat customers who were couples on a date because we felt their needs would be a subset of new customers who were looking for a romantic evening out. We also decided not to focus on new customers who were coming to the theatre as a group because it was more likely that at least 1 member of the group has been there before and the business seemed to be focused on drawing repeat customers.

**Update:** Our client *finally* sent out our survey through the newsletter, so we now have some data on users' top tasks!

Some takeaways:

- Most respondents were between 35-54 years old. Gender was roughly 50/50 male and female.
- Most live outside of Central District.
- Most respondents have not been to Central Cinema within the last 3 months.
- Most respondents visit Central Cinema's website monthly.
- Most repondents hear about upcoming/new movies and shows through the newsletter.
- Most respondents buy movie tickets either on the day of the show or a few days before it. Majority do not buy advanced tickets more than 24 hours before the show.
- Over half buy tickets primarily in person.
- The top 3 tasks on the website are: (1) checking movie times, (2) looking up upcoming shows, and (3) seeing food/drinks menu and purchasing tickets (last 2 were tied).

## Next Steps

- Meet as a group to solidify our personas
