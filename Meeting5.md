Below are our findings and insights!

### Stakeholder Interviews (Nikhil)

**Summary:** We interviewed Kevin, the owner of Central Cinema, and Brian, a staff who worked there for 4.5 years. We learned how they described the business in their own words, their business goals, the website design goals, the customer profile, and the channels they use to reach them.

**Findings:**
- Kevin mentioned the word "neighborhood" several times when describing the business, which suggests that the aspect of neighborhood, location, and/or community is important to him.
- They tightly curate their movie selections, picking cult classics that will likely resonate with customers and fall appropriately in-line with events in the area, like Pride Week.
- Kevin initially started the business to bring the concept of "Beer Theatre" to Seattle, which he felt were lacking after visiting Portland.
- The type of customers it attracts seems to be dependent of the particular show.
- Its primary revenue stream is restaurant sales and the remaining from ticket sales. This means that the primary revenue stream is dependent on the lesser revenue stream, which is a huge risk for the sustainability of the theatre.
- The primary goal for the redesign is to increase advanced ticket sales online. This is done to help the business plan ahead and resource accordingly. Usually more popular shows like Sing-Alongs are sold out about a month in advance.
- There has been a fair amount of complaints about the TicketBiscuit ticketing module that's integrated into the website. They have gotten complaints about the calendar displaying upcoming shows and customers who had accidentally bought tickets for the wrong day.
- Central Cinema uses multiple social media channels to reach their audiences, including Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. The engagement on those platforms seem to be pretty high.

**Implications:**
- Since the concept of "neighborhood" is important to the DNA of the brand itself, the website might need to "act" neighborly as well -- such as promoting surrounding busiensses, enable/encourage customers to connect with each other, or provide relevant info about the area. It might need to more visually display pride of being located in Central District.
- The staff don't *just* pick cult movies; they are thoughtful in the way they do it. So this needs to be communicated to the audience as a differentiating factor. The website should serve to enhance the emotional connections people have to certain movies.
- Each show might need to be more targeted rather than aimed towards a "general audience." Audience segments may need to be prioritized to reflect revenue generation. If Sing-Alongs and Cartoon Happy Hours are bigger revenue generators, they might need to "headline" the website while it fill in gaps with "smaller acts." 
- Also, since the audience may span multiple subgroups, the website needs to accommodate channels that overlap with the most subgroups to focus on the most important ones.
- There is a huge opportunity to use the website as a primary driver of sales at the top of the sales funnel. This might de-risk dependency on bringing enough people in to sustain their primary revenue stream.
- TicketBiscuit seems to be a technical constraint of the redesign. It needs to be better integrated into the site or the redesign should addreess how to rely less on TicketBiscuit to provide essential info to users.
- For the redesign, we may need to better integrate social media activities into the website instead of just limiting them on the sidebar.

### User Interviews (Clem)

**Summary:** We interviewed 3 participants around University of Washington at the beginning of each guerrilla usability tests. We didn't focus so much on getting the right demographic of participants as much as getting as much information as possible due to time constraints. We asked the following questions (besides demographic info):

- What kinds of events do you buy tickets for? Why?
- How did you find the event/show?
- How did you choose the theatre?

**Findings:**
- Participants watched movies more frequently at home than watching movies theatres. They treated going to the theatre as a special occasion. Going to theatre with friends is an added benefit that seem to motivate participants to choose to watch a movie at the theatre rather than at home.
- They prefer watching a big movie release at the theatre. They are more likely to buy tickets for them because they are afraid that tickets will sell out.
- They find out about the movie primarily through word-of-mouth, but goes online or to social media to search for more info about it. One participant "stars" events she's interested in to "save" the event.
- All participants we interviewed said location is important â€“ they pick a theatre based on which ones were closest to them.
- One mentioned she had a giftcard to a specific movie theatre so she chooses to go there.

**Implications:**
- None of the participants have been to Central Cinema, and they don't frequently watch movies, so they might be potential customers.
- The redesign should consider making bringing friends a priority or supporting referrals during consideration phase of the sales process.
- Highlighting the most popular shows and displaying social proof could make them seem more like a special occasions. If people search for the most popular shows, then we might be able to help them discover less popular or related shows. 
- Visually signify that certain shows are special (e.g. Sing-Alongs) or differentiate them the more regular events like cult movie showings.
- If we better integrate social media channels into the site, we could spread contextual info about each show across the channels consistently. This way, the channels will be better aligned with the website (and could be integrated with the ticket purchase process).
- Display location info prominantly if users search for this info frequently.

### Guerrilla Usability Testing (Demi)

**Summary:** We conducted usability tests with 3 participants aged between 21-44 years old, at the University of Washington and at a cafe. Our goal was to understand pain points around using the website, including ease of locating movie tickets, paths to purchasing tickets, and the type of info people were looking for. We studied participants running through 5 task scenarios using the Central Cinema website. We sought to answer the following questions:

- Can users find movie showtimes easily? More specifically, can they navigate to the right location to find specified dates? 
- How easily can users find where and how to buy tickets online?
- Can users quickly find the location information for Central Cinema?
- Are users able to navigate to the food menu?
- How quickly can users find help when they need it?

We didn't use performance metrics, only self-reported assessment of participants' experience.

**Findings:**
- Participants didn't realize Central Cinema served restaurant-style food, not just concessions.
- The website was hard to navigate.
  - The navigation bar contained too many items that made it hard to find what people wanted.
  - The headings of navigation were sometimes confusing (i.e. confusion over the difference between FAQ and Contact Us).
- Movie times were not easy to find.
  - The calendar was hard to use. It was too complicated.
  - There were 3 different ways of getting the same info so participants were confused whether they were using the right ones. (You can buy tickets using "Buy Tickets," "Upcoming Shows," and Calendar format.)
- Critical info were hard to find.
  - Participants couldn't find were Central Cinema were located. (All users missed the "Getting Here" label in the navigation.)
  - Participants were confused over the difference between FAQ and Contact us, and 2 participants assumed the contact info would be at the footer instead.

**Implications:**
- We might need to make the messaging more prominent to show Central Cinema is a dinner theatre. 
- The navigation may need to be consolidated and relabeled, and offer easier paths to complete most frequent tasks.
- The calendar format may not be appropriate for displaying movie times.
- We may need to better prioritize location information or make it easily accessible throughout all the pages. 
- Better differentiation of categories may be needed to signal what tasks could be achieved.

### Heuristic Evaluation (Spencer)

**Summary:** We used Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics to conduct our evaluation. The evaluation was performed on central-cinema.com against 45 criteria, where for each criteria, possible ratings ranged from "Very Poor" to "Excellent" and assigned a point value from 1-5 (1=Very poor, 5=Excellent). The criteria was weighted based on importance, from 100% for high importance and 20% for low importance. The overall score was computed using the weighted sum.

**Findings:**
- The overall usability score was 63 out of 100.
- This puts central-cinema.com in the "Moderate" category (between 49-69 points), which means users can use the site to complete the most important tasks but the user experience could be significantly improved.
- Most significant areas for improvement are Homepage, Features and Functionality, Content & Text and Navigation.
  - Homepage: There are too much content on the homepage which makes it somewhat unclear. There is no real overview of features and functionality; to find these would require some digging.
  - Features and Functionality: TicketBiscuit integration with site is extremely cumbersome and clunky. Frequently used tasks are easily accessible but somewhat hard to find. Call to actions on homepage are  extremely ineffective; they're hard to see among rest of page content.
  - Content and Text: The content is too detailed and too cluttered; They are not 'scannable'. The links are shown in context but they not discernable from headings in many cases.
  - Navigation: The navigation is clearly labeled and will get you to where you want to go, but some pathways are confusing. (i.e. What is the difference between "Upcoming Shows" and 'Calendar"?)

**Implications:**
- We need to better prioritize content on the homepage to help users find the most relevant information. We should make these pathways visually and semantically clear with headings and labels. 
- We should consider consolidating pathways to give users clearer ideas where to find critical info. Think about contextual menu options and info people frequently need to access on-the-fly.
- Provide clearer call to actions to indicate where people should take action. This would direct people to take action when and where appropriate. 

### Contextual Inquiry (Setu)

**Summary:** We went to Central Cinema on a Saturday night showing of Shaun of the Dead because it was supposed to be the busiest day (according to Google Search). The purpose is to observe the demographic, what they did in the space, and get an overall feel for the entire theatre experience.

**Findings:**
- There was a lot of people buying tickets at the door.
- Most of the patrons were couples, mostly in their 30's or older.
- Most people ordered food and drinks before the movie started.
- Not many people milled around in the atrium/restaurant area before the movie started.
- Most people kept to themselves and didn't talk much during the movie.
- Aside from menu related questions, there weren't any major questions that were asked during the entire experience.

**Implications:**
- Central Cinema attracts mostly couples for movie nights, not throngs of people in groups. This might mean that what draws people here is a good cult movies that couples can enjoy together. This might also mean that the info they might look for on the website (and the questions they might ask) would be different than people are looking for special events like Sing-Alongs.
- The fact that many people bought tickets at the door suggests that perhaps these are people who might be from the neighborhood or who are not in the habit of planning ahead of time for events like this. It could also mean that the website is really hard to navigate and they have trouble completing the essential task of buying a ticket through the Central Cinema website.
- Patrons seemed to be familar with the concept of ordering food and drinks during the movie. They weren't surprised or inquisitive so it might mean they are regulars/repeat customers or they knew what to expect prior to coming here.
