## Agenda

- Share our findings from analyzing the data

## Discussion

We met to share our findings and see if we could derive some themes and insights from them. The methods we used in our research included:

- Stakeholder interviews (business discovery)
- User interviews
- Guerrilla usability testing
- Heuristic evaluation
- Contextual inquiry

Below are our findings and insights!

### Stakeholder Interviews (Nikhil)

**Summary:** We interviewed Kevin, the owner of Central Cinema, and Brian, a staff who worked there for 4.5 years. We learned how they described the business in their own words, their business goals, the website design goals, the customer profile, and the channels they use to reach them.

**Findings:**
- Kevin mentioned the word "neighborhood" several times when describing the business, which suggests that the aspect of neighborhood, location, and/or community is important to him.
- They tightly curate their movie selections, picking cult classics that will likely resonate with customers and fall appropriately in-line with events in the area, like Pride Week.
- Kevin initially started the business to bring the concept of "Beer Theatre" to Seattle, which he felt were lacking after visiting Portland.
- The type of customers it attracts seems to be dependent of the particular show.
- Its primary revenue stream is restaurant sales and the remaining from ticket sales. This means that the primary revenue stream is dependent on the lesser revenue stream, which is a huge risk for the sustainability of the theatre.
- Central Cinema uses multiple social media channels to reach their audiences, including Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. The engagement on those platforms seem to be pretty high.

**Implications:**
- Since the concept of "neighborhood" is important to the DNA of the brand itself, the website might need to "act" neighborly as well -- such as promoting surrounding busiensses, enable/encourage customers to connect with each other, or provide relevant info about the area. It might need to more visually display pride of being located in Central District.
- The staff don't *just* pick cult movies; they are thoughtful in the way they do it. So this needs to be communicated to the audience as a differentiating factor. The website should serve to enhance the emotional connections people have to certain movies.
- Each show might need to be more targeted rather than aimed towards a "general audience." Audience segments may need to be prioritized to reflect revenue generation. If Sing-Alongs and Cartoon Happy Hours are bigger revenue generators, they might need to "headline" the website while it fill in gaps with "smaller acts." 
- Also, since the audience may span multiple subgroups, the website needs to accommodate channels that overlap with the most subgroups to focus on the most important ones.
- There is a huge opportunity to use the website as a primary driver of sales at the top of the sales funnel. This might de-risk dependency on bringing enough people in to sustain their primary revenue stream.
- For the redesign, we may need to better integrate social media activities into the website instead of just limiting them on the sidebar.

### User Interviews (Clem)


### Contextual Inquiry (Setu)

**Summary:** We went to Central Cinema on a Saturday night showing of Shaun of the Dead because it was supposed to be the busiest day (according to Google Search). The purpose is to observe the demographic, what they did in the space, and get an overall feel for the entire theatre experience.

**Findings:**
- There was a lot of people buying tickets at the door.
- Most of the patrons were couples, mostly in their 30's or older.
- Most people ordered food and drinks before the movie started.
- Not many people milled around in the atrium/restaurant area before the movie started.
- Most people kept to themselves and didn't talk much during the movie.
- Aside from menu related questions, there weren't any major questions that were asked during the entire experience.

**Implications:**
- Central Cinema attracts mostly couples for movie nights, not throngs of people in groups. This might mean that what draws people here is a good cult movies that couples can enjoy together. This might also mean that the info they might look for on the website (and the questions they might ask) would be different than people are looking for special events like Sing-Alongs.
- The fact that many people bought tickets at the door suggests that perhaps these are people who might be from the neighborhood or who are not in the habit of planning ahead of time for events like this. It could also mean that the website is really hard to navigate and they have trouble completing the essential task of buying a ticket through the Central Cinema website.
- Patrons seemed to be familar with the concept of ordering food and drinks during the movie. They weren't surprised or inquisitive so it might mean they are regulars/repeat customers or they knew what to expect prior to coming here.
