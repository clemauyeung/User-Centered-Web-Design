- Share our findings from analyzing the data

## Discussion

We met to share our findings and see if we could derive some themes and insights from them. The methods we used in our research included:

- Stakeholder interviews (business discovery)
- User interviews
- Guerrilla usability testing
- Heuristic evaluation
- Contextual inquiry

Below are our findings and insights!

### Contextual Inquiry (Setu)

**Summary:** We went to Central Cinema on a Saturday night showing of Shaun of the Dead because it was supposed to be the busiest day (according to Google Search). The purpose is to observe the demographic, what they did in the space, and get an overall feel for the entire theatre experience.

**Findings:**
- There was a lot of people buying tickets at the door.
- Most of the patrons were couples, mostly in their 30's or older.
- Most people ordered food and drinks before the movie started.
- Not many people milled around in the atrium/restaurant area before the movie started.
- Most people kept to themselves and didn't talk much during the movie.
- Aside from menu related questions, there weren't any major questions that were asked during the entire experience.

**Implications:**
- Central Cinema attracts mostly couples for movie nights, not throngs of people in groups. This might mean that what draws people here is a good cult movies that couples can enjoy together. This might also mean that the info they might look for on the website (and the questions they might ask) would be different than people are looking for special events like Sing-Alongs.
- The fact that many people bought tickets at the door suggests that perhaps these are people who might be from the neighborhood or who are not in the habit of planning ahead of time for events like this. It could also mean that the website is really hard to navigate and they have trouble completing the essential task of buying a ticket through the Central Cinema website.
- Patrons seemed to be familar with the concept of ordering food and drinks during the movie. They weren't surprised or inquisitive so it might mean they are regulars/repeat customers or they knew what to expect prior to coming here.
