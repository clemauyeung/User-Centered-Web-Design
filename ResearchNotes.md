## Research notes

We went to Central Cinema on Saturday to watch *Shaun of the Dead* as well as conduct contextual inquiry and customer interviews. Our goal was to validate data we gathered from our client about our users and to just experience Central Cinema itself (only 1 member of our group has been there).

Below are our notes from the visit!

### Contextual inquiry

Issues:

Customers:
- Advanced ticket buyers
  - Did not encounter any
- At the door ticket buyers
  - Patrons bought tickets at the door - did not encounter any who had pre-bought tickets
- Food buying customers
 - Most customers ordered some kinds of concessions-- food, snacks and/or beer
- Repeat customers
  - One coupled seemed to already know one member of the wait staff, and chatted with him casually
- Kinds of Customers
  - The movie beforehand consisted of couples and groups of older women-- 30’s and up (Bridget Jones’ Diary)
  - Primarily couples in the 9:30pm showing (Shaun of the Dead)
  - Few single individuals

Staff:
- Front door staff 
  - Multiple staff members in the front-- one veteran and one in training
- Wait staff
  - Multiple waitstaff members moving throughout the theatre (2 dedicated wait staff members)
- Any other interactions that we don’t know about
  - Front door staff helped with some aspects of food ordering-- they aided in delivering food to customers, but did not take orders.

Types of Interactions:

Buying tickets:
- Buying tickets in person/getting will-call tickets
  - Tickets were bought in person - did not see any patrons who had bought tickets in advance
- Is there a line?
  - No line was formed for the later 9:30pm event
- Is there a difference in process between advanced ticket purchasers or present purchasers?
  - Could not see-- N/A

Patrons in the Space (Before, During and After:
- Communication between and amongst patrons
  - Many patrons came in a group of people (2-4)
  - Primarily couples that appeared to be on date night
- How they talk and engage?
  - Talk was fairly quiet before the movie
  - During the movie, there was a quiet environment
- How do they wait before movies?
  - There was one couple sitting and drinking in the outside space before the film began-- when it started, they shifted into the theatre with food that they had already purchased
  - Many patrons already had food/beverages before the film started
  - Patrons talking amongst their parties primarily, did not see patrons conversing among different parties
- Movie watching experience
- Engagement level during the movie
  - Patrons seem very interested in the movie
  - Only a few patrons checked their phones intermittently
  - If not directly watching, patrons were also eating
- Any kinds of questions that arise?
  - Did not notice any major questions arise
- How does the process end, and how do patrons leave the theatre?
  - Patrons trickle out-- paying food bill or talking with their counterparts

Seating:
- Find seating
  - Patrons did quick “eye sweeps” before choosing where to sit
- How they navigate seats?
  - Most patrons opted for the closer seating over the top rows

Ordering food tableside:
- How customers order
  - Most, if not all parties of people ordered food before the movie and during (Food service continues throughout the evening)
- What the process is like—beginning, middle and end process
  - Wait staff member comes to patrons, menus available on all tables
  - Food is ordered and  brought out to patrons throughout the movie
  - Last calls are called to given for food orders
  - Food bills are brought out towards the end of the film
- What kind of questions do they ask?
  - Questions about food offerings
- What do they seem to know?
  - Patrons seemed aware of how to order food, and the overall process

### Stakeholder interview

We planned to do customer interviews, but there weren't many people outside the theatre milling around and most people in the theatre kept to themselves/within their group. So we interviewed a staff member instead (consider this person a customer support/front lines person).

How would you describe your audience?
- Clientele is primarily family and women in the 30’s age range
- People who want to watch movies primarily from the 80s-90s
- Date night movies

What common questions or difficulties that customers experience?
- Sometimes people do not realize that we serve food tableside
- Ticket buying issues online-- TicketBiscuit has some weird issues
  - Even people who frequently buy tickets online have issues sometimes-- not quite sure what the issues are though
  - Depending on their browser, the format and experience of buying can get messed up somehow
  - I think that we used to used Brown Paper tickets before switching to TicketBiscuit
- Also,  people can have issues with the online calendar. Like sometimes, they accidentally buy a ticket for the wrong day. Not sure why that is an issue, but there’s something with the calendar or TicketBiscuit. I know a couple of months ago, Kevin was considering changing the ticketing service. He wasn’t super into TicketBiscuit, but I don’t know how he feels about it right now. 

What kind of events are most popular?
- Definitely our family showings like Miyazaki films do really well with parents and kids
- Thursday night happy hours always get crowded
- Some movies are always really popular-- like The Princess Bride
- Special events like the 90s singalong is very popular-- sold out a month in advance.

What are your busiest days?
- Apart from Thursdays, Saturdays are pretty busy. It has been kind of slow these past few weeks. Summer can also get a little slow. 

Who would you say are your competitors?
- Probably the biggest competitor is the chain Cinebarre, they are similar but different
- Big Picture also does food, but they are really expensive

How do people find out about you?
- Usually through The Stranger, email, newsletters
- Word of mouth is really big too
- We also have a Groupon-- the Groupon is problematic because they have these kind of punch cards.
- Sometimes people who live nearby don’t even realize that we’re here
