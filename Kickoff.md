## Discussion

Our team went to Central Cinema to meet Kevin on-site to do client research. Everyone took notes. We learned about the business and its customers that frankly upturned some of our earlier assumptions.

### Below are Demi's notes. 

Brand + Business Goals:
* About CC
  * Central Cinema is a neighborhood going out spot, a dinner spot 
  * Opened in 2006, been in business for 11 years
  * Want to connect with audiences: People who live in houses are more inclined to stay in their homes. People who live in apartments go out more
  * Beer + Theatre in Seattle was a major goal in creating Central Cinema
* Revenue
  * Primary 1/3 is ticket sales, 1/3 is food sales
  * Encourage online sales and advanced ticket sales
  * About 1/3 books tickets in advance which is helpful for particular nights 
    * Helpful for planning staffing and understanding how big events will be -- get a sense for the type of crowd. Good predictor.
  * Want to encourage people to make plans, not just having the mentality of going to see a movie. He wants them to commit to those plans.
  * Tickets are put up 2 months in advance: Kept consistent for all events usually. Do monthly planning = Monthly get together to plan for events
    * Gauging the audience, keep track of movies to go through
    * Like to bring back popular movies over and over -- need to explore the curation of the films
  * Menu is changed up every couple of months -- relatively narrow, 6 beer taps, keep it narrow.
    * Keep things narrow -- keeping a minimal curation-- make it easy to make a good choice
  * Each movie has unique audiences and experiences, different kinds of experiences
* Business Goals
  * Want people to clearly see what the upcoming shows will be (not necessarily in calendar format)
  * How to get tickets for the events -- Use TicketBiscuit, a plugin kind and small customization
  * Special Events Spotlights - Like happy hour things and ticketed events = like neighborhood parties and non-ticketed like cartoon happy hour 
  * Highlighting the dinner theatre aspect and menus and cocktail menus
  * Showcasing where it is located - Highlight the CD

Customers/Users:
* Slightly skewed towards women: 30-40s age group of women, little older audience
* Movies affect the crowds: Depends on what people are interested and are shown
* Mix of crowds -- Want to target the nice evening out
 * Film purists -- less social
 * Want to encourage groups of people and that kind of crowd
 * Wants to target the what people that want to go out
* Crowds:  A lot of segments
 * Have some people that come every week. Older guy. Cartoon Thursdays with family and everyone kind of falls into different niches
 * Looking for entertainment -- Reliving or sharing an event
 * Sharing with generations
 * Emotional moments
* Watch movies and eating == ideal, easy and fun for a wide audience
* Repeat customers often buy at the door
* Kickstarter “Keep Central Cinema Fun” -- 3 years ago, digital cinema changeover and it was necessary to upgrade

 * Sad romantic movie - set out flowers and tissues
 * Monty Python - give out coconuts 
 * Heathers - provide cap guns 
 * Food - special cocktail that goes along with movies

Customers/Users:
* Who are your current customers and what do you know about them?
  * Live in apartments. People who live in houses don’t tend to go out as much. Having a hard time gettng people from the hyper-local area. Mostly a single family home neightborhood. 
 * People come in from Capital hill, other neighborhoods as well.
* Core people: Cap hill, beacon hill. Madrona. U-district. 
  * Also: Queen Anne, Ballard.

  * Curated collection of movies - “you don’t have to figure out something.”
 * People like to have choices, but not too many. 
 * “Looking for interesting entertainment - reliving something fun or sharing an experience with someone else.” Playing classic films, parents bring their kids.
* How do you prioritize them?
 * We are chasing the more general ‘going out crowd’.
 * “We try to keep things going that people respond to”
 * Hold events based on other events - gay movies the week before pride, but not pride week.
* How do most people find out about you?
 * The Stranger, not for tourists guides, “weekly” publications

### Below are Clem's notes. 

Business/brand - could you describe the business?
* Central Cinema (CC) is a neighborhood theater. It’s going out spot that people go out of the way to come here. 
* We go to some other neighborhood to go out, why can’t we have some place like this in Central District (CD)?
* Beer theater don’t exist in Seattle. We saw in Portland, why not in Seattle? Movie doesn’t really matter, just the beer. Felt Seattle was lacking it.

Revenue stream:
* 1/3 ticket sales, 2/3 restaurant sales
* Channels - ticket sales on the website and at the door.
 * Encourage online sales because it’s advanced sales -- less [?] if bought earlier, online
 * Sing alongs sell out way in advance
 * Helps with planning and staffing so we’re not surprised.
* We try to sell 3x more ticket sales online usually
 * It’s good because customers make plans ahead of time. Kind of like season ticket holders. 
 * Group planning is hard. Don’t want to make last minute plans.
 * Usually put 2 months out for ticket sales. 
  * Kevin do monthly get together to figure out what program will fit. In meeting with Doug, we decide based on gut feel. We have been doing this for a long time.
  * We sometimes bring popular things back
  * We try different combos and think about how to do complete sets
  * The point is not to have everything - like Netflix people scroll through. Make it easier on people to choose. Menu change up too. 
  * We put packs of tissues if movie is sad. White Russians for Big Lebowski. We extended movie with David Bowie when he died. 

Audience:
* People who live in houses are more of a homebody, so it’s hard to draw people in houses around here. People in apartments go out more.
* More women than men
 * 30s-40s, some 20s - because we play cult classics
 * Appeal to nice evening out. Not so much film purists because they tend to be less social
 * Try not to overlap with Pride - rather play movies leading up to it as warm up
* We don’t really have a target. Appeal to lots of different people.
 * Loyal customers - older retired guy, couple from bainbridge, families that don’t miss the cartoon HH
 * People who fall into a niche
 * They usually like to relive something fun. They grew up with the film and want to introduce it to their kids. Extended Labrynth when Bowie died - make it special
 * Launched a Kickstarter campaign for a new projector - title “Keep CC fun with digital projector upgrade”

Top goals for website:
* Display upcoming shows
 * Help people find tickets for those
 * Use ticking system TicketBiscuit
* Highlight/spotlight special events
 * Cartoon Thursdays Happy hour
 * Other events that’s not ticketed like neighborhood block party
* Info about the dinner theater
 * Current menu and cocktail menu
 * Location - people used to ask “is it safe to go there” because of contentious history of the area
  * Visitors - mainly around here: Beacon Hill, Capital Hill, Central District, Madrona

Channels/social media:
* Email newsletter 1x per week
  * Get ideas from people
* Facebook is good reinforcement
 * For announcement
 * Downside if people don’t spend time doing other things
* Instagram is fun
  * Avoid being too commercial - like other businesses who just post about themselves
 * Made a photoshop mashup of movies
* Getting RSVPs is hard
 * People have a habit of not showing up 
 * It’s like a reminder

What success means - outcomes beyond wildest dreams:
* Website is seamless and beautiful
 * Right now it has too many layers
* Increase advanced ticket sales
* Increase newsletter sign ups 
 * Currently have 7000 subscribers
 * Get people thinking about CC and give them ideas for things to do
 * Notify them and serve as reminder to drive people to the website
