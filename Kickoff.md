## Discussion

Our team went to Central Cinema to meet Kevin on-site to do client research. Everyone took notes. We learned about the business and its customers that frankly upturned some of our earlier assumptions.

Below are Demi's notes. They are condensed and edited for clarity.

Brand + Business Goals:
* About CC
  * Central Cinema is a neighborhood going out spot, a dinner spot 
  * Opened in 2006, been in business for 11 years
  * Want to connect with audiences: People who live in houses are more inclined to stay in their homes. People who live in apartments go out more
  * Beer + Theatre in Seattle was a major goal in creating Central Cinema
* Revenue
  * Primary 1/3 is ticket sales, 1/3 is food sales
  * Encourage online sales and advanced ticket sales
  * About 1/3 books tickets in advance which is helpful for particular nights 
    * Helpful for planning staffing and understanding how big events will be -- get a sense for the type of crowd. Good predictor.
  * Want to encourage people to make plans, not just having the mentality of going to see a movie. He wants them to commit to those plans.
  * Tickets are put up 2 months in advance: Kept consistent for all events usually. Do monthly planning = Monthly get together to plan for events
    * Gauging the audience, keep track of movies to go through
    * Like to bring back popular movies over and over -- need to explore the curation of the films
  * Menu is changed up every couple of months -- relatively narrow, 6 beer taps, keep it narrow.
    * Keep things narrow -- keeping a minimal curation-- make it easy to make a good choice
  * Each movie has unique audiences and experiences, different kinds of experiences
* Business Goals
  * Want people to clearly see what the upcoming shows will be (not necessarily in calendar format)
  * How to get tickets for the events -- Use TicketBiscuit, a plugin kind and small customization
  * Special Events Spotlights - Like happy hour things and ticketed events = like neighborhood parties and non-ticketed like cartoon happy hour 
  * Highlighting the dinner theatre aspect and menus and cocktail menus
  * Showcasing where it is located - Highlight the CD
