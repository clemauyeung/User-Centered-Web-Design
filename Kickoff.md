## Discussion

Our team went to Central Cinema to meet Kevin on-site to do client research. Everyone took notes. We learned about the business and its customers that frankly upturned some of our earlier assumptions.

Below are our team's notes. They are edited and condensed for clarity.

### Demi's notes 

Brand + Business Goals:
* About CC
  * Central Cinema is a neighborhood going out spot, a dinner spot 
  * Opened in 2006, been in business for 11 years
  * Want to connect with audiences: People who live in houses are more inclined to stay in their homes. People who live in apartments go out more
  * Beer + Theatre in Seattle was a major goal in creating Central Cinema
* Revenue
  * Primary 1/3 is ticket sales, 1/3 is food sales
  * Encourage online sales and advanced ticket sales
  * About 1/3 books tickets in advance which is helpful for particular nights 
    * Helpful for planning staffing and understanding how big events will be -- get a sense for the type of crowd. Good predictor.
  * Want to encourage people to make plans, not just having the mentality of going to see a movie. He wants them to commit to those plans.
  * Tickets are put up 2 months in advance: Kept consistent for all events usually. Do monthly planning = Monthly get together to plan for events
    * Gauging the audience, keep track of movies to go through
    * Like to bring back popular movies over and over -- need to explore the curation of the films
  * Menu is changed up every couple of months -- relatively narrow, 6 beer taps, keep it narrow.
    * Keep things narrow -- keeping a minimal curation-- make it easy to make a good choice
  * Each movie has unique audiences and experiences, different kinds of experiences
* Business Goals
  * Want people to clearly see what the upcoming shows will be (not necessarily in calendar format)
  * How to get tickets for the events -- Use TicketBiscuit, a plugin kind and small customization
  * Special Events Spotlights - Like happy hour things and ticketed events = like neighborhood parties and non-ticketed like cartoon happy hour 
  * Highlighting the dinner theatre aspect and menus and cocktail menus
  * Showcasing where it is located - Highlight the CD

Customers/Users:
* Slightly skewed towards women: 30-40s age group of women, little older audience
* Movies affect the crowds: Depends on what people are interested and are shown
* Mix of crowds -- Want to target the nice evening out
 * Film purists -- less social
 * Want to encourage groups of people and that kind of crowd
 * Wants to target the what people that want to go out
* Crowds:  A lot of segments
 * Have some people that come every week. Older guy. Cartoon Thursdays with family and everyone kind of falls into different niches
 * Looking for entertainment -- Reliving or sharing an event
 * Sharing with generations
 * Emotional moments
* Watch movies and eating == ideal, easy and fun for a wide audience
* Repeat customers often buy at the door
* Kickstarter “Keep Central Cinema Fun” -- 3 years ago, digital cinema changeover and it was necessary to upgrade

Customers/Users:
* Who are your current customers and what do you know about them?

 * “We try to keep things going that people respond to”
 * Hold events based on other events - gay movies the week before pride, but not pride week.
* How do most people find out about you?
 * The Stranger, not for tourists guides, “weekly” publications

### Clem's notes 

Business/brand - could you describe the business?
* Central Cinema (CC) is a neighborhood theater. It’s going out spot that people go out of the way to come here. 
* We go to some other neighborhood to go out, why can’t we have some place like this in Central District (CD)?
* Beer theater don’t exist in Seattle. We saw in Portland, why not in Seattle? Movie doesn’t really matter, just the beer. Felt Seattle was lacking it.

Revenue stream:
* 1/3 ticket sales, 2/3 restaurant sales
* Channels - ticket sales on the website and at the door.
 * Encourage online sales because it’s advanced sales -- less [?] if bought earlier, online
 * Sing alongs sell out way in advance
 * Helps with planning and staffing so we’re not surprised.
* We try to sell 3x more ticket sales online usually
 * It’s good because customers make plans ahead of time. Kind of like season ticket holders. 
 * Group planning is hard. Don’t want to make last minute plans.
 * Usually put 2 months out for ticket sales. 
  * Kevin do monthly get together to figure out what program will fit. In meeting with Doug, we decide based on gut feel. We have been doing this for a long time.
  * We sometimes bring popular things back
  * We try different combos and think about how to do complete sets
  * The point is not to have everything - like Netflix people scroll through. Make it easier on people to choose. Menu change up too. 
  * We put packs of tissues if movie is sad. White Russians for Big Lebowski. We extended movie with David Bowie when he died. 

Audience:
* People who live in houses are more of a homebody, so it’s hard to draw people in houses around here. People in apartments go out more.
* More women than men
 * 30s-40s, some 20s - because we play cult classics
 * Appeal to nice evening out. Not so much film purists because they tend to be less social
 * Try not to overlap with Pride - rather play movies leading up to it as warm up
* We don’t really have a target. Appeal to lots of different people.
 * Loyal customers - older retired guy, couple from bainbridge, families that don’t miss the cartoon HH
 * People who fall into a niche
 * They usually like to relive something fun. They grew up with the film and want to introduce it to their kids. Extended Labrynth when Bowie died - make it special
 * Launched a Kickstarter campaign for a new projector - title “Keep CC fun with digital projector upgrade”

Top goals for website:
* Display upcoming shows
 * Help people find tickets for those
 * Use ticking system TicketBiscuit
* Highlight/spotlight special events
 * Cartoon Thursdays Happy hour
 * Other events that’s not ticketed like neighborhood block party
* Info about the dinner theater
 * Current menu and cocktail menu
 * Location - people used to ask “is it safe to go there” because of contentious history of the area
  * Visitors - mainly around here: Beacon Hill, Capital Hill, Central District, Madrona

Channels/social media:
* Email newsletter 1x per week
  * Get ideas from people
* Facebook is good reinforcement
 * For announcement
 * Downside if people don’t spend time doing other things
* Instagram is fun
  * Avoid being too commercial - like other businesses who just post about themselves
 * Made a photoshop mashup of movies
* Getting RSVPs is hard
 * People have a habit of not showing up 
 * It’s like a reminder

What success means - outcomes beyond wildest dreams:
* Website is seamless and beautiful
 * Right now it has too many layers
* Increase advanced ticket sales
* Increase newsletter sign ups 
 * Currently have 7000 subscribers
 * Get people thinking about CC and give them ideas for things to do
 * Notify them and serve as reminder to drive people to the website

### Nikhil's notes 

How would you describe Central Cinema?
* “Neighborhood going out spot."
* “Neighborhood dinner theatre."
* “For the neighborhood by the neighborhood"
* Movies + Beer + Food + Social fun!
* Just the fact that you can have a few beers, kick back with a movie and eat a sandwich!

Revenue stream:
* Primary stream:  1/3 ticket sales, 2/3 restaurant sales
* Sales channels: Online Ticketing through website, also at the door.
 * 1/3 books online in advance, 2/3 at the door.
 * Expect to triple the advanced sale at the door.
 * Trying to promote online sales more by offering $2 discount.
 * Sales go online 2 months ahead of time.
* Advantages to book online: Good to have customers plan ahead, because the plans are made. 
 * It also helps predict the kind of crowd that comes on a particular day. Helps with staffing and predictability.

Feelings that customers need to feel:
* Each movie is aimed at different crowds.
 * Movies are curated on a monthly basis, and updated every month, showing what is going to show 2 months in advance.
* They give people quirky props and items, depending on the movie.
* Menu also might be modified to add things based on movie playing.
 * “White Russian” for when big lebowski was playing.
 * Little changes to make the experience nicer (delight factor).

Top goals for the website:
* Users should be able to clearly see what shows are coming up and find a way to buy tickets. (Right now the ticketing system had a calendar feed, spotlight, etc.)
 * “TicketBiscuit” - the ticketing system they use.
 * “It’s nice to have to only put that information in once, instead of having to type it over and over."
* “Spotlight” to highlight other events (non-ticketed), like neighborhood parties, happy hours. (Thursdays - cartoon happy hours, sports events)
* Something to describe the fact that they are a dinner theater, to show menus, and cocktail menus.
 * Location is important because central district isn’t well known.
  * Visitors come from all over the city, but mainly the core neighborhoods: Capitol Hill, U-district, Beacon Hill, etc.

Customers:
* Slightly skewed towards women, than men
* 30s and 40s age group
* A fair amount in the 20s, but mostly older because they play cult and classic movies.
 * A lot of city people.
 * They try to spread the programming around so they get different demographics.
* Try to curate events based on what’s going on around the city.
 * Trying to appeal to the customers who just want a nice movie out and want to have a good time
 * Also have customers who are film purists, etc. 
* Loyal customers - yes. Different groups for each kind of events. Loyal families with kids for cartoon night, etc.

**“Seamless and beautiful for people to just come there, find shows, book it"**

Ideally, the website should:
* Increase online advance ticket sales
* Increase email newsletter signup
 * Newsletter serves as a reminder that Central Cinema exists as a good weekend hangout choice.
 * Newsletters are weekly
 * They drive people to the website.

### Setu's notes -- they are on paper :(

## Reflection

Overall, we had tons of fun learning about our client. We covered busienss goals, sucess metrics, and customer profile. What we might do differently is to designate a client lead and have him/her lead the questioning and keep us on track. We plan to go back to Central Cinema over the weekend to experience the magic for ourselves!

## Next Steps

* Synthesize our notes from client meeting
* Create a survey to send out to Central Cinema's newsletter readers
* Inform client about website data we want to look at
* Perform competitive analysis (everyone pick one)
* Discuss what should go into our Project Plan
