## Discussion

Our team went to Central Cinema to meet Kevin on-site to do client research. Everyone took notes. We learned about the business and its customers that frankly upturned some of our earlier assumptions.

### Below are Demi's notes. They are condensed and edited for clarity.

Brand + Business Goals:
* About CC
  * Central Cinema is a neighborhood going out spot, a dinner spot 
  * Opened in 2006, been in business for 11 years
  * Want to connect with audiences: People who live in houses are more inclined to stay in their homes. People who live in apartments go out more
  * Beer + Theatre in Seattle was a major goal in creating Central Cinema
* Revenue
  * Primary 1/3 is ticket sales, 1/3 is food sales
  * Encourage online sales and advanced ticket sales
  * About 1/3 books tickets in advance which is helpful for particular nights 
    * Helpful for planning staffing and understanding how big events will be -- get a sense for the type of crowd. Good predictor.
  * Want to encourage people to make plans, not just having the mentality of going to see a movie. He wants them to commit to those plans.
  * Tickets are put up 2 months in advance: Kept consistent for all events usually. Do monthly planning = Monthly get together to plan for events
    * Gauging the audience, keep track of movies to go through
    * Like to bring back popular movies over and over -- need to explore the curation of the films
  * Menu is changed up every couple of months -- relatively narrow, 6 beer taps, keep it narrow.
    * Keep things narrow -- keeping a minimal curation-- make it easy to make a good choice
  * Each movie has unique audiences and experiences, different kinds of experiences
* Business Goals
  * Want people to clearly see what the upcoming shows will be (not necessarily in calendar format)
  * How to get tickets for the events -- Use TicketBiscuit, a plugin kind and small customization
  * Special Events Spotlights - Like happy hour things and ticketed events = like neighborhood parties and non-ticketed like cartoon happy hour 
  * Highlighting the dinner theatre aspect and menus and cocktail menus
  * Showcasing where it is located - Highlight the CD

Customers/Users:
* Slightly skewed towards women: 30-40s age group of women, little older audience
* Movies affect the crowds: Depends on what people are interested and are shown
* Mix of crowds -- Want to target the nice evening out
 * Film purists -- less social
 * Want to encourage groups of people and that kind of crowd
 * Wants to target the what people that want to go out
* Crowds:  A lot of segments
 * Have some people that come every week. Older guy. Cartoon Thursdays with family and everyone kind of falls into different niches
 * Looking for entertainment -- Reliving or sharing an event
 * Sharing with generations
 * Emotional moments
* Watch movies and eating == ideal, easy and fun for a wide audience
* Repeat customers often buy at the door
* Kickstarter “Keep Central Cinema Fun” -- 3 years ago, digital cinema changeover and it was necessary to upgrade

 * Hold events based on other events - gay movies the week before pride, but not pride week.
* How do most people find out about you?
