## Agenda

## Discussion

### Visiting Central Cinema

We decided to go to Shaun of the Dead on Saturday :) While there, we will conduct contextual inquiry validate data from client interview as well as get a better feel for the actual experience of Central Cinema. Specifically, we want to see the demographics of people attending a show, who buys tickets at the door, and what happens in the space before, during, and after the show.

### Competitive analysis

**Cinerama**

The good:
- Great branding and visual style
- Prioritized information: ticket booking is the focus and it's easy to find shows and their times
- Responsive website with consistent mobile experience
- Easy to find important information like location, parking, public transport
- Actual ticket purchase experience is straight-forward

The bad:
- Seat selection feature is hard to use on the mobile site
- Some buttons on the site has low contrast with the background and could pose accessibility issues
- The calendar of shows is sufficient but could be improved
- The badges on the homepage look like clickable links but they aren't

**EMP (Experience Music Project) Museum**

The good:
- EMP serves a diverse audience of patrons, and it encourages people to buy tickets for all the different events
- Experience of ticket purchse is easy on convenient
- Website is visually appealing, with right amount of text and images throughout 
- Mobile experience makes buying tickets even mroe easily and quickly than the desktop site

The bad:
- Extremely long dropdown menus, which arenn't organized in any particular manner
- Hard for users to navigate through many of the events offered and find the specific ones they want to go to
- Navigation bar is relatively well organized, but there seems to be some overlap between *Visit* and *About*
- It's not obvious that it's a continuous scroll because the navigation has extensive dropdowns
- There are a lot of programs on the site but the site doesn't explicitly or clearly show them

**Sundance Cinemas**

The good:
- Clear calls-to-action and highlighting the menu
- Movies that are currently showing are highlighted on the page (but not labeled)
- Since Sundance is a franchise, it does a good job of highlighting all the other locations

The bad:
- Website is not optimized for mobile - it's not responsive, and performing some actions on the mobile site could lead to some content or menu cut off from the screen
- IA is generally confusing - the navigation is not obvious
- Top tasks (one could expect) are completed by pop-up menus/dialog boxes, which covers the entire site and obscures the content underneath
- Text and images are generally small, and this might cause readability issues
- The visual experience of the website doesn't live up to the upscale experience of visitng Sundance

**Big Picture Movie Theatre**

The good:
- Value proposition and messaging is clearly displayed on the homepage
- Media reviews on the homepage shows social proof and good ratings
- Movie showtimes are clear and easy to understand

The bad:
- The website is poorly designed, and the upscale brand doesn't translate online
- The website is text heavy, and the color palette seems to clash
- IA is very deep and might not help users quickly navigate to the right page/content or recover from errors
- The images are oddly-sized and it's not engaging to look at them

### What we learned



## Project Plan

We went over the document as a group to revise/give feedback on the draft. The completed [Project Plan] (https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5HWOOZbwIIzelJyZldiOV9Vbnc/view?usp=sharing) is accessible through the link.
