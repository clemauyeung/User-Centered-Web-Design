### Personas

We discussed what we needed to include in our personas, including things we should highlight for goals, frustrations/pain points, and needs. After, we named our personas as shown below:

**Dating Dave / Boyfriend Brad** - "craft beer guy," "good dates"

- Demographics:
  - early 30's
  - live in Capital Hill

- Goals:
  - try somethiing different and more memorable than just going to a dinner at a restaurant
  - take his gf on a fun, casual date night - place that's comfy, feels like home (but not)
  - share a positive experience that builds their relationship

- Frustrations:
  - hard finding unique things to do with his gf
  - why don't theatres serve beer?!
  - good vegan food options are few and far in between at most restaurants

- Needs:
  - decide whether Central Cinema is a good place for a date - the place needs to be fun and unique
  - make sure the movie is worth it - "I wanna try something different," "watch movie they both love"
  - figure out dinner plans for their date - that serves vegan food - "dinner + date?"
  - not terribly out of the way - what else could we do nearby?

**Planning Pam** - repeat customer, "just loves Central Cinema," "her girlfriends just wanna have fun!"

- Demographics:
  - mid 40's
  - lives in Columbia City

- Goals:
  - get her girls together to catch up
  - just hang out like old times
  - not worry about moving from place to place - find a central meeting point

- Frustrations:
  - hard to coordinate everybody and find day/time that works
  - hassle of buying tickets or getting everyone to buy the same tickets
  - finding more info about upcoming shows to share with her friends

- Needs:
  - a trusty place to go out on a night out so they know they'll have fun
  - easy to find info on showtimes and movie info to share with her friends
  - make sure restaurant and theatre can accommodate her group
  - be informed about ingredients on the food in case someone has dietary restrictions or food allergies
